## Motivation

### Last month people were interested in LangChain and Code For Dayton's MontyBot example

#### Links
* [Code for Dayton](https://www.codefordayton.org/posts/)
* [MontyBot Repo](https://github.com/codefordayton/montybot)

<br>

### LinkedIn

* On LinkedIn, the following question was posted
  * "How to I express on my resume, I can do the latest XYZ, even though I do not have experience in that because I have lots of experience."

* Posted response from ChatGPT looked awesome!
   * Absolutely, you can convey your adaptability and quick learning skills...

## Continued. 

Absolutely, you can convey your adaptability and quick learning skills on your resume without sounding arrogant or dismissive. Here's a suggestion on how to incorporate that sentiment into your resume in a professional manner:
<br>
<br>
Previous Experience: <br>
Senior [Your Industry] Professional | [Company Name] | [Dates of Employment]<br>
***Spearheaded*** the successful adoption of new technologies, demonstrating the ability to rapidly learn and apply unfamiliar concepts within a tight timeframe.<br>
Consistently ***stayed at the forefront*** of industry trends by quickly acquiring expertise in emerging tools and techniques, contributing to the company's innovation and growth.<br>
***Leveraged*** [specific examples of technologies or tools you've learned quickly] to enhance operational efficiency and drive results.<br>
***Demonstrated*** a passion for continuous learning, consistently adapting to new challenges and expanding skillset to meet evolving industry demands.

## LangChain

Let's see what we can do with LangChain and ChatGPT.

---

## What is LangChain

LLM models have no memory.  Each API call is a standalone interaction.  So we wanted it to build a custom, biography (aka LinkedIn) and a custom resume for company xyz we would have to resupply it with all of our information.

<br>
<br>

See Medium's [Custom Memory article](https://towardsdatascience.com/custom-memory-for-chatgpt-api-artificial-intelligence-python-722d627d4d6d)

<br>

### LangChain

LangChain gets around costly prefeeding conversation history by optimize the right memory type for your application.

<br>
<br>

**Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app â€” the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.**

<br>

**This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.**

---

## Setup

NOTE: Need python > 3.8.10


```python
pip install langchain
pip install openai
pip install chomadb
```

<br>
<br>

### Create environment key

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=123#3431`1....
```

---

## Python Code

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
chatgpt = OpenAI()
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chatgpt)
promt = "How do I show I can learn this skill quickly"
conversation.predict(input=promt)
```

```bash
' The best way to show that you can learn a skill quickly is to practice it frequently. It is important to focus on the basics of the skill and build up your knowledge and expertise gradually. You should also focus on understanding the underlying concepts of the skill so that you can easily apply it in different situations. Additionally, it is helpful to find resources, such as tutorials or online courses, that can help you learn the skill in an efficient and effective way.'
```

---

## Now, let's try it with a resume.

### Example based on Langchain Tutorial

[Memory in the Multi Input Chain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/adding_memory_chain_multiple_inputs)

* Document
* Memory

---

## Example


```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma


resume = "../data/CV.md"
with open("resume") as f:
    resume_data = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1200, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(resume_data)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

---

```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
docsearch = Chroma.from_texts(
    texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{"source": i} for i in range(len(texts))]
)

query = "What are skills, experiences, education and abilities"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)

```

---

## Results

Got a better resume results with ChatGPT vs LangChain.

Howevery, got a good results for summary.
